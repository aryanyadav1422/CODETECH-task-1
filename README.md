OVERVIEW-
# Basic Calculator

A simple Java program that acts as a basic calculator. The program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

---

## Objectives
1. Provide a user-friendly tool for performing basic mathematical operations.
2. Ensure robust error handling for invalid inputs and exceptional cases like division by zero.
3. Create a foundational project that demonstrates Java programming concepts such as input handling, control structures, and error management.

---

## Key Activities
1. Accept two numbers as input from the user.
2. Prompt the user to select an arithmetic operation:
   - Addition (`+`)
   - Subtraction (`-`)
   - Multiplication (`*`)
   - Division (`/`)
3. Perform the chosen operation and display the result.
4. Handle invalid input, invalid operations, and division by zero gracefully.
5. Display appropriate error messages to guide the user.

---

## Features
- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Handles invalid input and division by zero with clear error messages.
- Simple and interactive command-line interface.

---

## Technology Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Development Tools:**
  - Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
  - Text Editor (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or Terminal
- **Input/Output:** Standard Input/Output (Command-Line)

---

## How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
2. The user chooses one of the following operations:
   - Addition (`+`)
   - Subtraction (`-`)
   - Multiplication (`*`)
   - Division (`/`)
3. The program performs the chosen operation and displays the result.
4. If an invalid input or operation is provided, the program displays an appropriate error message.

---

## Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure you have Java 8 or later installed on your system.
- **Text Editor or IDE:** Use any Java-supported IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or a simple text editor with terminal access.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the file `BasicCalculator.java`.
2. Compile the Java file using the following command:
   ```bash
   javac BasicCalculator.java
